Here we have code for practical3

Here we, 

*Calculate the values of tan(x) where x is in radians in the range [0, 60] every five degrees.
*Create a function/subroutine that calculates the area under the curve of tan(x) from 0 â†’ 60
degrees using the Trapezoidal Rule. 
*There should be one argument, the number of points, and the return value is the area
